# Auth Service

A microservice responsible for authentication and authorization, built with **OAuth2** support for secure API access.  
Provides token-based authentication, role-based access control, and easy integration with other microservices in the ecosystem.  
Additionally, this service works as a **Kafka producer** to push **sign-up events** for downstream processing.

## üì° Kafka Integration for Sign-Up Events
Whenever a new user successfully registers, the Auth Service publishes a sign-up event to the Kafka topic specified in the environment configuration (`sendWelcomeEmailEvent`).  
This enables downstream microservices to perform actions like sending welcome emails, creating default user settings, or updating analytics.
